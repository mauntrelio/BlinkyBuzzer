/*

In this example we show how to give a buzzer "feedback" when pressing a button.
Button non-blocking debouncing is based on the example at https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/debounce

If you need to perform more complex operations and/or manage many buttons 
you may consider using a library, like, for instance, Switch (https://github.com/avandalen/avdweb_Switch/)
